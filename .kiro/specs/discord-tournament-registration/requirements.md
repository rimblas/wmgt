# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Discord bot that enables players to register for tournaments directly through Discord. The bot will handle time slot selection with proper time zone conversion, allowing players worldwide to understand when tournaments occur in their local time. Previous players of the tournament will already have a default timezone in the system. The system will integrate with existing backend APIs to manage registration data and enforce registration deadlines.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a tournament player, I want to register for tournaments through Discord, so that I can easily sign up without leaving the Discord platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. IF registration is successful THEN the bot SHALL confirm the registration with tournament details
5. IF registration fails THEN the bot SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

4. IF a player's timezone is invalid THEN the bot SHALL request a valid timezone selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a tournament player, I want to unregister from tournaments before they start, so that I can change my plans if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player uses the unregister command THEN the bot SHALL display their current registrations
2. WHEN a player selects a registration to cancel THEN the bot SHALL call the backend API to unregister the player
3. IF the backend API allows unregistration THEN the bot SHALL confirm the cancellation
4. IF the backend API rejects unregistration THEN the bot SHALL display the reason provided by the API
5. WHEN unregistration is successful THEN the bot SHALL confirm the cancellation with updated registration status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a tournament system, I want the Discord bot to integrate with existing backend APIs, so that registration data is consistent across all platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN it SHALL authenticate with the backend API system
2. WHEN processing registrations THEN the bot SHALL use existing API endpoints for player registration
3. WHEN processing unregistrations THEN the bot SHALL use existing API endpoints for player removal
4. IF API calls fail THEN the bot SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log errors appropriately
5. WHEN API responses are received THEN the bot SHALL validate the response format before processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a tournament player, I want to receive clear feedback about my registration status, so that I know whether my registration was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registration is in progress THEN the bot SHALL show a loading indicator or status message
2. WHEN registration completes successfully THEN the bot SHALL display confirmation with tournament details
3. WHEN registration fails THEN the bot SHALL explain the reason for failure and suggest next steps
