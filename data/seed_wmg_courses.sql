The Widow''s Walkabout environment is a love letter to all of our favorite Victorian Gothic depictions of eerie haunted houses. From Guillermo del Toro to Disney''s Haunted Mansion, with additional inspirtation from the Addam''s Family and Series of Unfortunate Events, we pulled together all of our favorite haunted abodes and created this tribute to all things spooky, kooky, and ooky.

Widow''s Walkabout Hard is our love letter to vintage noir haunted house films of the past like The Haunting (1963) and The House on Haunted Hill (1959) with just a touch of Addam''s Family and the Munsters sprinkled in.
