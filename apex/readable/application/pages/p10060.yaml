      This web application is built using <a href="https://apex.oracle.com/en/" target="_blank">Oracle APEX</a> with the purpose of running, analyzing and exploring 
      the results of the weekly <a href="https://www.mightycoconut.com/minigolf" targer="_blank">Walkabout Minig Golf</a> tournaments.<br>
      </br>
      Oracle APEX is a Low Code platform that goes from Low Code all the way to High Control. Behind the scenes there is an Oracle Database, PL/SQL Code, 
      SQL statements, plus some JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The whole project is available in <a href="https://github.com/rimblas/wmgt" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br> 
      <br>
      All the analysis is comprised of multiple hand crafted SQL statements that slice and dice the available data.<br>
      As such, although great care has been put into the correct presentation of results and statistics, there may be omisions and mistakes in some of the results.<br>
      That said, several people have been involved during testing and validation week after week; as well as providing new ideas so that the best results possible can be provided.<br>
