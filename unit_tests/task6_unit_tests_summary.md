# Task 6 Implementation Summary: Tournament Control Unit Tests

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive unit tests for the tournament control functionality as specified in task 6. All tests are passing and provide thorough coverage of the tournament control system.

## Test File Created

**File**: `test_tournament_control_unit_tests.sql`

## Test Coverage

### Section 1: wmg_tournament_control Table Operations (6 tests)
- âœ… Insert valid tournament control record with audit columns
- âœ… Insert NULL tournament_session_id (tournament break scenario)
- âœ… Update record and verify audit trigger functionality
- âœ… Primary key constraint violation handling
- âœ… Foreign key constraint violation handling
- âœ… Delete tournament control records

### Section 2: Tournament Control Management Procedures (8 tests)
- âœ… `set_tournament_control` with valid data
- âœ… `get_tournament_control` with valid data
- âœ… `clear_tournament_control` functionality
- âœ… `validate_tournament_session` with valid ID
- âœ… `set_tournament_control` with invalid tournament type (error handling)
- âœ… `set_tournament_control` with invalid session ID (error handling)
- âœ… `get_tournament_control` with invalid tournament type (returns NULL)
- âœ… `validate_tournament_session` with invalid ID (error handling)

### Section 3: Tournament Control Integration Tests (5 tests)
- âœ… Tournament control integration with management procedures
- âœ… Tournament break scenario handling
- âœ… Multiple tournament types independence
- âœ… Tournament control consistency (set/get/clear)
- âœ… Non-existent tournament type handling

### Section 4: Error Handling Scenarios (2 tests)
- âœ… Error constants verification
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling across all procedures

## Key Features Tested

### Data Integrity
- Primary key constraints on `tournament_type_code`
- Foreign key constraints to `wmg_tournament_sessions`
- Nullable `tournament_session_id` for tournament breaks
- Audit column population (created_on, created_by, updated_on, updated_by)
- Audit trigger functionality

### Tournament Control Management
- Setting active tournament sessions for specific tournament types
- Retrieving current tournament session IDs
- Clearing tournament control (tournament break state)
- Validating tournament session existence
- Independent control for multiple tournament types (WMGT, KWT, FHIT)

### Error Handling
- Invalid tournament type handling (raises -20100 error)
- Invalid tournament session ID handling (raises -20101 error)
- Non-existent tournament types return NULL (tournament break state)
- Proper error constants and messaging

### Tournament Break Support
- NULL tournament_session_id represents tournament break
- `get_tournament_control` returns NULL for non-existent types
- `clear_tournament_control` sets tournament_session_id to NULL

## Test Results

## Requirements Compliance

All specified requirements are fully tested and verified:

- **1.1**: Tournament control table operations âœ“
- **1.2**: Data integrity and constraints âœ“  
- **1.3**: Audit trail functionality âœ“
- **2.1**: Tournament control management procedures âœ“
- **2.2**: API procedures with tournament types âœ“
- **3.1**: Error handling for invalid data âœ“
- **3.2**: Error constants and messaging âœ“

## Test Design Decisions

### Realistic Test Data
- Uses actual tournament session IDs from the database
- Validates that test sessions have proper tournament relationships
- Handles cases where test data might be incomplete

### Error Handling Philosophy
- `get_tournament_control` returns NULL for invalid types (correct behavior)
- `set_tournament_control` and `validate_tournament_session` raise errors for invalid data
- Tests verify both success and failure scenarios

### Tournament Break Testing
- Extensively tests NULL tournament_session_id scenarios
- Verifies that tournament breaks are handled gracefully
- Tests multiple tournament types in different states

### Integration Focus
- Tests focus on the tournament control logic rather than REST API output
- Validates the core functionality that supports the `current_tournament` procedure
- Ensures tournament control procedures work correctly together

## Usage

To run the unit tests:

```sql
@test_tournament_control_unit_tests.sql
```

The tests are self-contained and include:
- Automatic test data setup and cleanup
- Detailed pass/fail reporting
- Requirements coverage verification
- Comprehensive error scenario testing

## Conclusion

The unit tests provide comprehensive coverage of the tournament control functionality and verify that all requirements are met. The tests are robust, well-documented, and provide clear feedback on the system's behavior in both normal and error conditions.
