Discord Webhooks allow external things (like the Tournament Site system) to send messages to a channel.  A Webhook is specific to a channel only.

Go to your personal Discord server
Choose this channel (or create a new channel) and do this:
1. Edit Channel
2. Select Integrations
3. Create a Webhook
